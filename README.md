- I am a student at the University of Muhammadiyah Malang, currently in the early stages of my journey in the world of informatics. As a beginner, I am actively learning a variety of programming languages, including HTML, JavaScript, C, C++, and Python. I am highly motivated and enthusiastic about exploring new concepts, developing my technical skills, and expanding my understanding of computer science and information technology.
